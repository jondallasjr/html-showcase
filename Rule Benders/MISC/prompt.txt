Connect everything to practical outcomes.\n\nLanguage Style\n\nShort, punchy sentences for impact\n\nSpecific over generic: \"£1,500/day rate\" not \"high income\"\n\nActive voice: \"I built\" not \"was built\"\n\nPlain English - explain complex concepts simply\n\nKey Phrases\n\nUse: \"Here's what I've learned...\" • \"The reality is...\" • \"Most people think X, but...\" • \"After 17 years of...\" • \"What actually works is...\"\n\nAvoid: \"Studies show...\" • \"Generally speaking...\" • Corporate jargon • Academic language\n\nCredibility Integration\n\nWeave achievements into storytelling:\n\n\"When I was billing £2,000/day at the Treasury...\"\n\n\"The framework that saved taxpayers £500 million...\"\n\n\"After building three consulting businesses...\"\n\nContent Approach\n\nLead with transformation.

Every piece should have immediate takeaways.\n\n1.1.1.2 Folder: Courses\n\n1.1.1.2.10 Course: Developing your SaaS Product\n\n1.2.1 Brand Identity: Audience\n\nMid-career professionals, career changers, and individuals entering the workforce — especially those across all English-speaking nations (UK, US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada), including professionals working in or with government — who are tired of capped salaries, rigid systems, and being undervalued.\n\nDigitally native or digitally fluent\n\nDisillusioned with slow promotions, rigid job specs, and empty credentials\n\nHungry for autonomy, meaning, and leverage in their work\n\nOpen to new models: consulting, solopreneurship, or launching niche brands\n\nValue directness, transparency, and proven results over hype or vague promises\n\n1.2.2 Writing Guidelines: Voice\n\nConversational tone that builds relatability\n\nApproach that encourages emotional responses: inspired, empowered, understood, motivated, connected\n\nPersonal branding element: showing face with a knowing half-smile\n\nUse of proverbs and Matrix movie concepts (seeing through systems)\n\n1.2.3 Brand Identity: Core USPs\n\nReal Instructors with Real Track Records: Every Rulebender course is taught by a practitioner, not a theorist or influencer — people who've done it in the real world and are ready to teach you how.\n\nAnti-System, Unfiltered Education: We challenge the old rules — from university debt to corporate bottlenecks — and replace them with real, actionable strategies that work today. No fluff. No sugar-coating. Just results.\n\nMulti-School Ecosystem: Rulebenders is a platform of elite niche schools, each led by a high-achieving Rulebender instructor, covering paths like Consultancy, Recruitment, Fashion, Art, Sustainability, and more.\n\nInstructor Launchpad Model: Many instructors have big followings but haven't monetized yet. Rulebenders becomes their business engine — enabling course creation, marketing, and revenue at scale.\n\nBuilt for the Future of Work: We teach career strategies aligned with real trends: AI, freelancing, independence, skill-based careers, global consulting, and portfolio work. We're not preparing students for jobs — we're helping them design lives.\n\n\"Want to earn +£1000 per day?\"\n\n\"How to triple your income, climb the ladder faster than the rest while taking mini retirements\"\n\n\"Learn the skills needed to become a highly paid Consultant\"\n\n\"Fast-Track your Career. Bend The Rules. Build your Future.\"\n\n\"Pick a career and learn how to get to the top in half the time\"\n\n\"Break free from the constraints of your job\"\n\n1.2.4 Brand Identity: Mission\n\nTo empower ambitious professionals to break free from outdated systems — like traditional employment, university degrees, and rigid career ladders — and instead build high-income, flexible, and fulfilling careers on their own terms. We deliver elite, tactical education through real instructors with real results.\n\n1.2.5 Writing Guidelines: Personality\n\nIntelligent, charismatic, fun and inspiring\n\nConversational, not formal\n\nFun and authoritative\n\nBold and controversial in messaging\n\n1.2.6 Brand Identity: Positioning\n\nRulebenders isn't just a school. It's a rebellion. Against underpaid jobs. Against pointless degrees. Against the slow lane. We equip driven individuals to bend the rules, skip the queue, and take what's theirs — faster.\n\n1.2.7 Brand Identity: Purpose\n\nTo make people feel there are shortcuts to career success\n\nTo help people understand, change, or work around existing systems and processes\n\n1.2.8 Brand Identity: Key Messaging Themes\n\nAnti-system, pro-results. The voice is that of a modern operator: someone who's escaped the rat race and now shares the playbook\n\n1.3.2 Writing Guidelines: Writing Guidelines\n\nDO: \n\nReal-World Experience: All lessons and examples should be grounded in actual experience — personal, professional, or industry-based\n\nOutcome-Focused Content: Every section should point toward a real outcome — income growth, freedom, skill mastery, business success\n\nBold & Honest Communication: Use direct, plainspoken language. Cut the fluff. Tell people what they need to hear, even if it's tough\n\nTactical Frameworks: Break down complex processes into clear steps, templates, or mental models\n\nStory-Driven Teaching: Use personal journeys, client wins/failures, and case studies to anchor every concept\n\nDON’T\n\nDon't Use Academic or Generic Tone: No lectures. No corporate speak. No vague \"leadership\" talk or university-style essays. This isn't LinkedIn.\n\nDon't Fill with Motivation Instead of Substance: A little inspiration is good — but this isn't a self-help seminar. Every insight should be actionable, not abstract.\n\nDon't Use Buzzwords Without Proof: Words like \"disruptive,\" \"agile,\" \"transformational\" need to be backed up with real explanation or examples — or left out.\n\nDon't Assume Everyone is Starting from Zero: Many learners are already professionals. Speak to them with respect and stretch their understanding — don't oversimplify.\n\nDon't Overstuff Lessons with Info: One core idea per lesson. Support it with a framework, a story, and an action. Leave space for learners to breathe and reflect.\n\n1.3.2.1 Writing Guidelines: Emotional Triggers\n\nFrustration with the system, desire for freedom, ambition to be more, fear of wasting time, hunger for results\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Writing Guidelines: Writing Voice\n\nAnti-system, pro-results. The voice is that of a modern operator: someone who's escaped the rat race and now shares the playbook\n\n1.3.2.3 Writing Guidelines: Writing Style\n\nShort, punchy sentences. Minimal jargon. Real-talk. Mixes storytelling with tactical insight\n\n1.3.2.4 Writing Guidelines: Writing Tone\n\nConfident, cheeky, direct, and unfiltered — but always grounded in credibility and real-world results\n\n1.3.2.5 Writing Guidelines: Citations\n\nReference Industry Standard Methodologies as Anchor Points\n\nAcknowledge and reference established methodologies (like SDLC, BPMN, TOGAF, PRINCE2, etc.) to provide credibility and context\n\nDon't teach these methodologies in detail but use them as reference points that learners can recognize\n\nExtract only the most practical and commonly used elements from these frameworks\n\nShow which parts of standard methodologies actually matter in real-world application\n\nProvide guidance on when to learn more about full methodologies based on specific career needs\n\n1.3.3 Content Guidelines: Course Content Guidelines\n\nGuidelines for Rule Benders Course Content Selection\n\nHere are the key guidelines that should be used when selecting specific content for Rule Benders courses\n\n1. Focus on Action-Oriented Outcomes, Not Theory\n\nPrioritize actionable shortcuts over comprehensive theory or background\n\nFrame objectives as action items (\"things the learner will be able to do\") rather than traditional learning objectives\n\nInclude only the essential 20% of information that drives 80% of results\n\nCut any content that doesn't directly lead to practical application\n\n2. Speed to Value is Critical\n\nFast-track implementation should be the top priority - learners should be able to apply concepts immediately\n\nCompress learning timelines from years to weeks by focusing on the most impactful elements\n\nInclude templates and frameworks that can be implemented right away\n\nBreak complex concepts into bite-sized, implementable chunks\n\n3. Structure Content as \"Cheat Sheets\" and Shortcuts\n\nPresent information as insider tips and \"what actually matters\" rather than comprehensive overviews\n\nEmphasize Rule Benders' \"hacks\" and unconventional approaches that bypass traditional paths\n\nPrioritize content that subverts or \"bends\" traditional rules to achieve faster results\n\nInclude real-world examples that demonstrate rule-bending in action\n\n4. Include Mindset Shifts and Self-Reflection\n\nIncorporate reflective elements to identify personal blockers or limiting beliefs\n\nInclude mental models that transform how learners perceive themselves and their work\n\nChallenge conventional thinking about experience, credibility, and positioning\n\nAddress mindset obstacles that prevent application of the content\n\n5. Balance Structure with Flexibility\n\nEach lesson should stand on its own while fitting into the broader narrative\n\nProvide a clear structure but allow for flexibility in how learners engage with content\n\nFocus on outcomes rather than rigid processes\n\nInclude both high-level overviews and tactical implementation details\n\n6. Make Content Visually and Emotionally Engaging\n\nUse simple visuals to communicate complex concepts\n\nApply clean, branded templates that enhance clarity rather than distract\n\nUse stories and case studies to create emotional connection and demonstrate real-world application\n\nCreate a tone that's professional but conversational - avoid academic or overly formal language\n\n7. Prioritize These Content Categories:\n\nPerception and positioning strategies (how to be seen as an expert)\n\nStakeholder influence and management techniques\n\nFast-track skill acquisition methods (for essential consulting skills)\n\nTools and templates for immediate implementation\n\nMental models and mindset shifts for thinking like a high-paid Consultant\n\nPractical methods for generating impact and value\n\nTactical approaches to building credibility and authority\n\n8. Content Selection Decision Framework\n\nWhen deciding whether specific content belongs in the course, ask:\n\nDoes it provide an immediate shortcut or advantage?\n\nCan learners implement it within days (not months)?\n\nDoes it challenge conventional thinking in the field?\n\nIs it focused on outcomes rather than processes?\n\nWould it be difficult to find this information elsewhere?\n\nDoes it help position the learner as high-value?\n\nCan it be presented in a clear, concise, actionable format?\n\nIf content doesn't meet most of these criteria, it should likely be omitted or significantly condensed.\n\n9. The \"Rule Benders Lens\"\n\nAll selected content should be filtered through the \"Rule Benders lens\" - meaning:\n\nLess theory, more application\n\nCompress long processes into bold, practical shortcuts\n\nAlways filtered through years of hands-on experience to make it real and relatable\n\nFocus on what works, not what's traditionally taught or academically \"correct\"\n\n10. Reference Industry Standard Methodologies as Anchor Points\n\nAcknowledge and reference established methodologies (like SDLC, BPMN, TOGAF, PRINCE2, etc.) to provide credibility and context\n\nDon't teach these methodologies in detail but use them as reference points that learners can recognize\n\nExtract only the most practical and commonly used elements from these frameworks\n\nShow which parts of standard methodologies actually matter in real-world application\n\nProvide guidance on when to learn more about full methodologies based on specific career needs\n\nBy applying these guidelines consistently, the course will maintain its distinctive Rule Benders approach - providing high-impact, actionable content that helps learners achieve results quickly rather than spending years on traditional learning paths.Consultants\n\n1.3.4 Research Guidelines: Research Guidelines\n\nStart with initial framework, then evolve based on lesson intent\n\nResearch from variety of sources:\n\nMajor consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG)\n\nGoogle Scholar, industry blogs, online articles\n\nCompetitor course outlines\n\nFilter everything through Rule Benders perspective:\n\nLess theory, more application\n\nCompress long processes into practical shortcuts\n\nInformed by personal experience to ensure relevance\n\n\n\n</TARGET_AND_CONTEXT_ENTITIES>\n\n\n\n<PRIORITIES>\n\nEssential\n\nVery Important\n\nImportant\n\nNIce\n\n<PRIORITIES>\n\n<ENTITY_TYPES>\n\nCompany\n\nCourse\n\nFolder\n\nInstructor\n\nBrand Identity\n\nContent Guidelines\n\nResearch Guidelines\n\nWriting Guidelines\n\nLesson\n\nSection\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nVisual Guidelines\n\nTypography Guidelines\n\nPhoto Generation Guidelines\n\nIcon Generation Guidelines\n\nHTML Guidelines\n\n</ENTITY_TYPES>\n\n9/12/2025 1:09:26 PM\n\n<RESPONSE_FORMAT>\n\nRespond in JSON for Entity Children.\n\nA single JSON object called “children” containing an array of suggested children with keys “name”, “entityType”, and “description”.\n\n{\n\n “thinking”: “”,\n\n “children”: [\n\n  {\n\n   “name”: “”,\n\n   “entityType”: “”,\n\n   “description”: “”\n\n   “priority”: “”\n\n  },\n\n  ...\n\n ]\n\n}\n\n\n\n</RESPONSE_FORMAT>"}],"thinking":{"type":"enabled","budget_tokens":2000},"max_tokens":50000},"codaWebhookUrl":"https://coda.io/apis/v1/docs/LS8jtbvEXB/hooks/automation/grid-auto-yecKyS0WKT","responseOptions":{"hasVision":false,"webSearch":true,"includeCost":true,"jsonContent":true,"includeWrapper":true,"includeThinking":true,"extendedThinking":true}}
