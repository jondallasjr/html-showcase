Claude generally performs better when I threaten embarassment.

We're keeping AI dumb.
People are concerned about the dumbing down of humans caused by AI. 
But I think a more serious issue is the dumbing down of AI caused by its users.
The hallmark of an AI-response nowadays is that often it's actually too good.
The reason I can't copy/paste Claude's responses into my work journal is because they're usually way too thorough, too precise. And 
So all the AI training to make it more human-sounding is likely dumbing it down.
